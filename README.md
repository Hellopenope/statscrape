# StatScrape

StatScrape is a NBA Roster and Stat Scraper built with Node.js, utilizing the Cheerio, Request, and Orchestrate npm's.

To run StatScrape as it is currently set up, you will first need an Orchestrate account, then you will insert your db key to access your specific collection.  Once that is set up, you can start it up by running `node statscrape.js` in the terminal.
